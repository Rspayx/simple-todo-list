# Description

This is a kind of simple to-do list that I wanted to also serve as a notebook, so it can be used for two purposes. This program has been created as a test and not much time has been spent on designing it; the focus has been on overall functionality. If you want, you can help in developing and improving the code and features of this to-do list . 

You can fully review the requirements in the Contribution section and participate in bug fixing, speed optimization, or adding features (such as adding favorites, etc.).
The languages and frameworks used in the code are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework :)

I would be happy if you could help in developing this code :)

## Contribution
Firstly, let me say that any help, even if it's not perfect, is welcome. However, in your own code, you must adhere to certain conditions so that we can develop this project as smoothly and effectively as possible : 

### requirements
- **Code cleanliness ,**
- **Code simplicity ,**
- **Avoidance of heavy images and content ,**
- **Code dynamism and avoiding unnecessary code ,**
- **Avoid using unnecessary and heavy libraries.**
- **Using languages and frameworks used in the project.**

#### 1- Code cleanliness : 
In the first stage, you should write clean code and add necessary comments where required to make it easier for other developers to understand. 

#### 2- Code simplicity : 
Try to avoid introducing complexity into your code as much as possible. This also relates to using clean code practices, which, if followed, naturally avoids unnecessary complexity.

#### 3- Avoidance of heavy images and content : 
To prevent the project size from increasing unnecessarily, avoid using heavy content such as large images, videos, GIFs, etc., as much as possible.
**However**, if absolutely necessary, you can use very limited and lightweight animated (video, GIF, etc.) and non-animated images.

#### 4- Code dynamism and avoiding unnecessary code:
Write your code as dynamically as possible and avoid unnecessary code that simply increases size and introduces performance issues.

#### 5- Avoid using unnecessary and heavy libraries: 
Try to avoid heavy and unnecessary libraries that are not essential for the project and do not justify their use in terms of size and utility.

#### 6- Using languages and frameworks used in the project:
Try to avoid changing languages or frameworks in your project unless absolutely necessary. For example, refrain from replacing Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS 
**unless there's a serious need and it significantly improves your code.**

#### *final word*
The main goal of these guidelines is to prevent your code from becoming bloated and excessively large. However, if following these rules leads to improving the quality of your code and project, you can deviate from them and implement the best type of code.
